We chose this deadline to make sure that we have the time to actually look at your submissions before we meet for discussion. We will mark your submissions and make the number of achieved bonus points available online in Stud.IP, but please note that we will not give you back the corrected submissions: If you have questions on how your grading, please visit the Wednesday session and ask questions! ðŸ˜‰\n",
